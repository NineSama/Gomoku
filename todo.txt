1. Check game logic after a capture cancelling a 5in a row :
    if you capture, opponent can just put stone back where it was captured and win ?
2. Care with bugs, u can win without by 5inarow without 5 in a row 
    (happened while testing, cant reproduce it)?
3. Add illegal 2 free-threes move

NB: need to force move after a pair is found on a 5 in a row
