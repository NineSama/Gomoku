1. Check game logic after a capture cancelling a 5in a row :
    if you capture, opponent can just put stone back where it was captured and win ?
    -> logically, if captures < 4 of opponent, game is over even if pair is capturable
2. Care with bugs, u can win without by 5inarow without 5 in a row 
    (happened while testing, cant reproduce it)?
3. Add illegal 2 free-threes move :
    create lines centered on the move, in 4 directions.
    check if when creating the line you see the pattern :
    .XXX.
    .X.XX.
    .XX.X.

    if you see that pattern more than once (>1) then its illegal move

NB: need to force move after a pair is found on a 5 in a row

HEURISTICS / MINIMAX / ALPHA BETA PRUNING

HEURISTICS : its a function that evaluates the board on how good the position is for a given player (or color in that case)
-> it returns a score depending on various parameters such as : 
    - number of stones
    - how many consecutive stones
    - are the ends open ?

    - opponent threats :
        - same evaluation that you have to substract to the score
    
    - captures
    etc ...

-> it is used to set a ranking on a position, that would be compared to other position's rankings

MINIMAX : recursive function that take in parameter:
    - the position
    - the depth
    - the color thats playing (calling the function)

    it calls the evaluate function, and after its recursion returns the best move at the given position 
    (after choosing from 10 depths for example)

ALPHA BETA PRUNING : way to make the minimax function faster, by eliminating branches that would by scoring,
    be worse than positions that have already been evaluated.

    considering Player is trying to maximise its score, while Opponent minimize it

//////////////////////////////////////
UPDATE :
    depth 2 is already way too long, need alpha beta pruning
    evaluate board needs to be really fast.

Hmmmmmm quand je place une pierre, celle ci n'impacte vrm que ses voisins a + ou - 5, 
est ce donc necessairede reevaluer le score des pierres non impactees ?

est ce quil y a moyen de savoir quest ce qui prend le plus de temps dexecution dans un programme ?

est ce que const dans les protoypes impacte les performances ?

std::vector<Position> moves = board.getCandidateMoves();
    ca copie le std::vector 
    const std::vector<Position>& moves = board.getCandidateMoves();
    -> pas de copie, lecture seule
