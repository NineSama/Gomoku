1. Check game logic after a capture cancelling a 5in a row :
    if you capture, opponent can just put stone back where it was captured and win ?
    -> logically, if captures < 4 of opponent, game is over even if pair is capturable
2. Care with bugs, u can win without by 5inarow without 5 in a row 
    (happened while testing, cant reproduce it)?
3. Add illegal 2 free-threes move :
    create lines centered on the move, in 4 directions.
    check if when creating the line you see the pattern :
    .XXX.
    .X.XX.
    .XX.X.

    if you see that pattern more than once (>1) then its illegal move

NB: need to force move after a pair is found on a 5 in a row
